XCOMMERCE WEBSITE HOSTING

Description :- This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a scalable and serverless ecommerce website hosting solution leveraging Amazon Web Services (AWS). The system ensures high availability, real-time data processing, and seamless integration of various AWS services to deliver a robust user experience.

Features:-The ecommerce website hosting solution offers a scalable, serverless architecture using AWS services, ensuring seamless performance during traffic spikes. It employs Amazon Kinesis Data Streams for real-time data ingestion and AWS Lambda for event-driven workflows, enabling quick and efficient processing. Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics provides low-latency insights, enhancing decision-making and operational efficiency. Static assets are securely stored and delivered via Amazon S3, while Amazon DynamoDB ensures fast and reliable access to user and transaction data. The system prioritizes cost-efficiency through AWS's pay-as-you-go model, robust security with encryption, and streamlined operations, making it ideal for modern ecommerce needs.
